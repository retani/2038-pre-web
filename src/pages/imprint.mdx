VI. Data security 
We use the common SSL (Secure Socket Layer) method in connection with the highest encryption level supported by your browser. As a rule, this is a 256-bit encryption. If your browser does not support 256-bit encryption, we use 128-bit v3 technology instead. You can tell whether an individual page of our website is being transmitted in encrypted form by the closed display of the key or lock symbol in the lower status bar of your browser. 

We also use suitable technical and organizational security measures to protect your data against accidental or deliberate manipulation, partial or complete loss, destruction or unauthorized access by third parties. Our security measures are continuously improved in line with technological developments. 

VII. Vimeo

We use Vimeo (Vimeo, Inc., 555 West 18th Street, New York, New York 10011, USA) to display embedded videos on our website. 

When you visit a page on our website where we have embedded the Vimeo plugin and interact with this plugin, e. g. by clicking on the start button for the video, a connection to Vimeo’s servers in the USA is established and Vimeo receives the information that you have visited the respective page of our website and played the embedded video. In this process, Vimeo receives you IP address and technical information about your device (e. g., browser type, operating system, and basic device information). If you have a Vimeo account and are logged in, Vimeo assigns the information about your interaction with the plugin to your Vimeo account; you may prevent this by logging out of your Vimeo account. 

There is an adequacy decision pursuant to Art. 45 GDPR regarding Vimeo’s data protection level, as Vimeo has self-certified its adherence to the principles of the EU-US-Privacy Shield (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt00000008V77AAE&status=Active). 

By using the Vimeo plugin on our website, you consent to the processing of personal data described above. Legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR. 

Vimeo is the controller for the personal data collected through its plugins. For more information on how Vimeo processes your personal data please visit Vimeo’s privacy policy (https://vimeo.com/privacy). 

VIII. Amendments of this privacy policy
